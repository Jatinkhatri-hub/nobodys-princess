Please ensure all buttons, hooks, velcro's, and zips are closed before washing your garments. Empty all pockets, and turn the garment inside-out before washing. Your garments only need to be washed when heavily soiled or at the end of your season.<\/p><p>Our outerwear has either a 15\/15K (pants and jackets) or 20\/20K (bibs) C0 waterproofing rating, with our treatment durability rated at 80\/20. This 80\/20 rating means that after 20 washes, the waterproofing is still going to work at an 80% efficiency. <\/p><p>When washing your garments, we do recommend using only a liquid washing detergent (no powder!) or a technical waterproofing product (Nikwax and NST) that can help extend the life of the waterproofing. Avoid harsh additives like fabric softeners, colour brighteners, or stain removers. <\/p><p><\/p>"}},"question_pNKBqc":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"<strong>How can I remove small marks\/blemishes?<\/strong>","answer":"<p>If you've got small marks or blemishes on your outerwear, you can spot treat these rather than washing the whole garment. <\/p><p>Depending on the stain\/mark, you can use a liquid washing detergent and water to blot or gentle rub the stain. If your stain is oil or grease based, using WD-40 or similar can also help by letting it sit on the stain for a few minutes before adding your detergent. <br\/><br\/>If unsure, please spot test before washing\/removing. All advice is a general and we cannot take responsibility for outcomes due to the variables that may occur with each washing environment. <\/p><p><\/p>"}},"question_C7fkLP":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"<strong>Can I repair broken elements\/rips?<\/strong>","answer":"<p>If you're unlucky enough to have a rip occur in your outerwear due to contact with a ski or board edge, tree branch, rock, or getting caught on any other object, they are usually repairable with a waterproof tape or patch. These are available from outdoor or camping stores, and come in a variety of shapes and sizes.<\/p><p>If you've encountered a broken zip, button, or other hardware item due to a cause not covered by\/outside of our warranty policy, we may be able to help with a repair.
