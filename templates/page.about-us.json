Working with an experienced snow apparel designer, we have identified the pain points that women experience, and made your snow pants everything they need to be.<\/p><p><em><strong>IT ALL STARTED ON A CHAIR LIFT.<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>I still remember the day - it was early in the snow season of 2018 and I was wearing my brand new snow pants. I loved them, snug fit, bright white, and they made my ass look great. In hindsight I knew they didn’t fit me 100%, but that was just the compromise, right?<\/p><p>So there I was, sitting on the chair lift with my friends on this non-windy day and I felt… cold. There WAS indeed a breeze… and it wasn’t in a pleasant place. It didn’t take long to realise what had happened - the crotch had given out. Now, normally I’d put it down to the pants just not being able to handle my amazing booty – but it was actually quite a harsh reality, they didn’t fit properly. And apparently, I wasn’t alone.<\/p><p>The girls on the lift with me quickly chimed in to how they too had experienced this, and the conversation quickly became about how frustrating it was to find good fitting snow pants. Size range, length, stretch, adjustability, room for bums and hips, well fitting waists. <\/p><p>The thing is, that conversation never stopped.<\/p><p>Almost every time we’d hit the snow, there would be something about our pants that prevented us from moving freely, that made us feel uncomfortable and insecure on the snow. It was about how our belts hurt from being done up so tight to try cinch the waist of our pants that were too big to try fit over our hips. It was about how we kept getting snow down our backside because the waists gaped. It was how we were too scared to bend over to adjust our boots out of fear that the crotch or backside of our pants would rip, or because they were too tight that we just physically couldn’t.<\/p><p><em><strong>IN 2020, THE IDEA BEGAN THE JOURNEY TO BECOME REALITY.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["template--16147330728126__bf09d5fe-bb21-43aa-9022-dea4bc7601c2-1684221323dea02f03-0","template--16147330728126__bf09d5fe-bb21-43aa-9022-dea4bc7601c2-1684221323dea02f03-1","template--16147330728126__bf09d5fe-bb21-43aa-9022-dea4bc7601c2-1684221323dea02f03-2"],"settings":{"separate_section_with_border":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1660895882994.jpg","reveal_on_scroll":true,"image_position":"end","content_width":"md","remove_vertical_spacing":false}},"a77bf124-505d-42fc-82eb-08d957c4002d":{"type":"image-with-text-block","blocks":{"template--16147330728126__a77bf124-505d-42fc-82eb-08d957c4002d-168422154523895141-0":{"type":"subheading","settings":{"text":"WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?"}},"template--16147330728126__a77bf124-505d-42fc-82eb-08d957c4002d-168422154523895141-1":{"type":"richtext","settings":{"content":"<p><em><strong>IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE STANDARD FOR WOMEN<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>If you're not comfortable, feeling confident, and having fun on the snow, then why are you there?
